# Asking For (And Getting) Help

## In general

The platform uses GitHub Issues for communication with users. Read, update or create issues under [the guidelines repository](https://github.com/dgt-mon/guidelines-for-drafting-manuscripts/issues) whenever you want to:

* ask a question,
* provide feedback,
* report a bug,
* request a feature.

## Search For Answers Before Asking A New Question

Before creating a new issue, search the list of issues to ensure your report is truly a new issue and not just a duplicate. If a similar issue already exists you should join the discussion: add an emoticon, add comment, update status, etc. Avoid duplicates wherever possible. Sometime a simple “thumbs up” icon is enough to show that you are experiencing the same issue or you have similar thoughts about some problem or suggested solution.

**Avoid duplicated issues.** Always search existing issues before creating a new issue.

## How To Ask For Help

Please read [the documentation on creating an issue in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository). We strongly suggest that you use issue templates to report a bug or request a feature.

When asking for help, it's crucial to put in the effort in being helped. Please describe your problem as clearly as possible:

* Before posting a question, we strongly recommend that you spend a reasonable amount of time researching the problem and reading the documentation.
* If your problem is with rendering of certain part of your manuscript for its paper or digital version, please include the input part, its the desired output and the actual output.

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking workflow.
