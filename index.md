# Guidelines for Drafting Manuscripts

The document provides guidelines for the drafting of manuscripts as well as for their submission for publication using the “Digital Publication” platform for digital publishing (also referenced as “the platform”). Additional instructions that supplement these general guidelines may apply depending on the specific subject area. These instructions have precedence, particularly in the case of conflicting guidelines/uncertainty.
Please draft your manuscript using a standard word processing application (Microsoft Word in particular). You may use your own document or the manuscript template provided.
To ensure smooth digital processing, it is mandatory that all documents be submitted in a uniform format. Therefore, we require the use of standard styles and file formats in your word processing software.
To help you with compilation of your manuscript, we offer the manuscript template. The template is compatible with Word 2007 or higher and contains basic style formats that fulfill our requirements with respect to structure, typography, and layout.
